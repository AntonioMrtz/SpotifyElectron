# Playlist Edit Bug Fix Verification

## Problem Description
The "Editar datos" (Edit data) option in the playlist context menu was redirecting to the Home page instead of opening the edit modal.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in `ContextMenuPlaylist.tsx` where the `handleEditPlaylistData` function was navigating to `/playlists/${playlistName}?edit=true`, but the actual route defined in `App.tsx` is `/playlist/:id` (singular, not plural).

## Fix Applied
Changed the navigation route in `ContextMenuPlaylist.tsx` line 232:
- **Before**: `navigate(\`/playlists/${playlistName}?edit=true\`, { replace: true });`
- **After**: `navigate(\`/playlist/${playlistName}?edit=true\`, { replace: true });`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Code Review
✅ **Route Definition Check**: 
- App.tsx line 73-75: Route is defined as `/playlist/:id`
- Sidebar.tsx line 169: Playlist links use `/playlist/${playlist.name}`
- ContextMenuPlaylist.tsx line 232: Now correctly uses `/playlist/${playlistName}?edit=true`

✅ **Consistency Check**:
- All playlist routes now consistently use `/playlist/` (singular)
- No other components use the incorrect `/playlists/` route

### 2. Functionality Verification
✅ **Edit Modal Logic**:
- Playlist.tsx lines 358-361: Correctly checks for `playlistEdit` localStorage flag
- Modal opens when flag is set to 'true'
- Flag is cleared after modal opens

✅ **Context Menu Integration**:
- ContextMenuPlaylist.tsx lines 234-236: Sets localStorage flag and closes menu
- Navigation uses `replace: true` to avoid history issues

### 3. Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User clicks playlist card in sidebar → navigates to `/playlist/{name}`
2. User clicks three dots menu → context menu opens
3. User clicks "Editar datos" → navigates to `/playlist/{name}?edit=true`
4. Playlist page loads and detects localStorage flag
5. Edit modal opens automatically
6. User can edit playlist details and save

### 4. Test Cases to Verify
- [ ] Context menu edit button navigates to correct route
- [ ] Edit modal opens when localStorage flag is set
- [ ] Modal only shows for playlist owner
- [ ] Form fields are populated with current playlist data
- [ ] Save functionality works correctly
- [ ] Navigation works for playlists with special characters in names
