# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and run FRONTEND

## üõ† Setup the proyect

### 1. Enter frontend folder

```console
cd Electron
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```console
npm install
```

### 3. Build main and renderer process

```console
npm run build
```

### 4. Run the app

#### Standar with hot reload

This will automatically reload the app if changes are made into Electron or React App.

```console
npm start
```

#### Debug (**Chromium based browser is needed**)

Using this mode breakpoints in VSCODE will be triggered

1. Launch VSCODE debug script `Electron: All`
2. Launch browser: `chromium --remote-debugging-port=9223 --user-data-dir=remote-debug-profile`. Replace `chromium` with the path of your browser executable
3. Go to `localhost:1212` on the launched chromium based browser
4. Refresh using F5 until the program stops at the selected breakpoint (this may require multiple refreshes).

### 5. Launch Backend for Frontend development with Docker

It's necessary to have Backend running for accesing certain parts of the interface. You can launch Backend for frontend development using the following commands:

```console
cd Backend/docker/;
./build_and_up_dev_standalone.sh
```

## ‚ñ∂ Select Music Player based on Song Architecture backend (optional)

You can select a custom music player dependending if the song architecture is managed by regular or serverless streaming. By default `BLOB` architecture service is selected.

### 1. Enter frontend global configuration file

```
cd Electron/src/global/global.ts
```

### 2. Select the music player streaming architecture

We have to selected if we want. Backend should also have the same architecture selected in order for songs to be played correctly.

#### BLOB (PRODUCTION and DEVELOPMENT)

The app ships with this architecture as the default

```ts
export const songArchitecture: SongArchitecture = SongArchitecture.BLOB_ARCHITECTURE
```

#### Serverless (deprecated)

```ts
export const songArchitecture: SongArchitecture = SongArchitecture.SERVERLESS_ARCHITECTURE
```
