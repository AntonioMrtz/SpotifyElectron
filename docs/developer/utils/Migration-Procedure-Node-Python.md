# Migration Procedure for Python and Node Versions

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to update Python and Node.js versions in the project. Following this procedure ensures consistency across development, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment environments.

## Steps to Update Python and Node Versions

### 1. Update Documentation
- Modify `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect the new versions of Python and Node.js required for the project.
- Ensure all references to the old versions are replaced with the updated versions.

### 2. Update Version Configuration Files
- Update `.nvmrc` with the new Node.js version.

### 3. Update Package Configuration
- Modify `package.json` to reflect the new Node.js version in the `engines` field.
- Run `npm install` to regenerate `package-lock.json` with the updated engine requirements.
- Ensure dependencies are compatible with the new Node.js version.

### Update container images (Dockerfile)
- Modify container images version to use the updated versions

### 4. Update CI/CD Pipelines
- Modify pipeline configuration files (`.github/workflows/*`) to use the updated versions:
  - Update `node-version` for Node.js.
  - Update `python-version` for Python.
- Verify that all pipeline scripts and dependencies work with the updated versions.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Run all unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to confirm compatibility.
- Check for any deprecations, breaking changes, or required updates in dependencies.
- If issues arise, update dependencies or modify the code accordingly.

## Additional Considerations
- Document any issues or fixes encountered during the migration process.
