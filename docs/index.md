# Welcome to Spotify Electron Documentation

Spotify Electron is a cross-platform music streaming desktop app made with Electron-React frontend and Python-FastAPI-MongoDB. The main goal is to reproduce the original Spotify functionality while adding new one like uploading songs.

This guide is designed to provide developers with all the necessary information to install, configure, use and extend the Spotify Electron application.
