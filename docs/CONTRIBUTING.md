# How to contribute

In this document we will cover how contribute to the project and the rules associated to the process. We gladly accept all kinds of contributions, from writing new features and fixing bugs to improve the existing documentation. When contributing to the project the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) must be followed.

We welcome any help you can offer and are eagerly waiting for your contributions.
Feel free to ask for assistance or guidance at any time. We encourage you to get involved because contributing to open source projects allows you to collaborate with other members,
improve your coding skills, and enhance your communication abilities.

## 🖐️ Steps to Contribute

1. Select an [issue](https://github.com/AntonioMrtz/SpotifyElectron/issues) and **ask to work on it by leaving a comment in the same link (Not Trello)**.
2. Create a new branch with the feature youre implementing using the [branch naming convention](Git-Convention.md).
3. Push your changes to the new branch using the [commit naming convention](Git-Convention.md).
4. Add tests for every functionality changed or added.
5. Go to your branch in Github, then select Pull Request and fill the fields indicated in the template. Remember to rename the Pull Request using our [convention](Git-Convention.md).

_It's important to leave a comment about working on an issue so the maintainer can add you as assignee and avoid two people working on the same issue_.

_Trello links are used to sync Github issues with board tasks, we're not accepting new members due to free tier limitation until you have contributed at least twice_.
