# üß± Database Migration

## Overview
This document describes the steps required to migrate an existing dataset from a database or revert a migration.
Migrations should take place whenever the persistent data schema changes, to avoid errors and data loss.

## Format

- Migrations should be create inside `scripts/migrations`
- Migrations should extend `BaseMigration` and implement `up` and `down` methods
- Each migration should be documented using module docstrings
- Each migration file should be named following this format:
```
yyyy_mm_dd__table_name__change_description.py
```
Example:
```
2025_04_20__songs__seconds_to_seconds_duration.py
```

## Requirements

- `Backend/` should be the root folder
- [Backend setup](../backend/SETUP.md) must be done before running any script


## ‚û°Ô∏è Migrate (Up)

This procedure will apply a migration on a dataset.

1. Go to Backend/
2. Create a migration file that extends `BaseMigration` class under `app/scripts/migrations`
3. Write module docs at the top of the file describing what the migration does
4. Add the following entrypoint:
```
migration = Migration()
asyncio.run(migration.execute_migration())
```
5. Run `python -m app.scripts.migrations.migration_file db_uri up`.
Example:
```
python -m app.scripts.migrations.migration_file mongodb://root:root@127.0.0.1:27017/ db_uri up
```

## üîô Revert Migration (Down)

This procedure will revert a migration on a dataset.

1. Follow the same steps as for doing a migration but instead execte this code:
```
python -m app.scripts.migrations.migration_file mongodb://root:root@127.0.0.1:27017/ db_uri down
```
